    <h3>Capital One</h3>
  		Software Engineering Internship<br>June 2019-August 2019
			<br>Technologies Used: AWS (EMR, S3, and Lambda), PySpark, Jenkins
  </div>
  <p>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		In the event of a third party data breach,
		Capital One has the obligation to identify which of its customers were
		potentially impacted and to notify them accordingly. When the Equifax breach
		happened in 2017 (over 150 million people's information compromised), Equifax
		sent Capital One all the customer data that had been potentially affected so that Capital
		One could identify all impacted customers.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>However, the manner in which Capital One went about identifying its customers from
		the Equifax breach was extremely unsafe. The social security numbers of all the breached
		Equifax customers as well as all Capital One customers were sitting in raw plaintext form
		on some on-premise server, where data analysts would run SQL queries to match breached Equifax
		accounts to Capital One customers based on social security numbers.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>Now that Capital One has gone all in on the cloud (all of its infrastructure is now hosted on
		AWS), that method of customer identification would be unacceptable for various security reasons such
		as having plaintext Social Security Numbers sitting at rest, giving human access to all this sensitive
		information, etc.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>My internship project was to develop an automated system to do all the customer matching so that a human
		would not have access to such a large amount of sensitive information. To mitigate having plaintext Social security
		Numbers sitting at rest, Capital One has now implemented tokeniziation on all sensitive data within the organization.
		When a third party sends Capital One all breached accounts, all sensitive information in those accounts will also be tokenized
		at the frontier. So instead of matching on plaintext Social Security Numbers, my system would match on their tokenized counterparts.
		Given the characteristics of tokenization, a match on tokens means a match on social security numbers...simple enough, right?
		</span>
		
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>I built out a contained environment to execute all the matching safely. My match engine uses a highly restricted AWS S3 bucket and a Lambda (to be automatically provisioned
		by my code when Capital One gets notified of a third party data breach). The Lambda expects the information all of third party breached individuals to land in the S3 bucket (in a CSV format) and
		will deploy the matching code  (which was written in PySpark) onto a provisioned Elastic MapReduce cluster,
		pull in all Capital One accounts from its data lake, and identify all customers. Then it will write all the results
		back into the same S3 bucket that was originally provisioned.
