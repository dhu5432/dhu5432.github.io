    <h3>CME Group</h3>
  		Software Engineering Intern<br>May 2018-August 2018
			<br>Technologies Used: Moto/Boto3, Pytest, Cloud Custodian

		Many companies these days are migrating to the cloud and CME Group is no different. However, given that
		the cloud is inherently less safe than on-premise data centers and servers, it is very important to ensure
		all cloud resources are well managed, secure, and optimized.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>This is where <a href="https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian">Cloud Custodian</a> comes in. It is an open source rules engine (originally developed by Capital One)
		for managing cloud resources. It allows users to define policies to enable a well managed cloud infrastructure. It can be used to ensure
		real time compliance to security policies like encryption, tag policies and cost management via garbage collection of unused resources.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>CME Group had a variety of (untested) Cloud Custodian policies to manage their AWS fleet and my internship project was to write
		a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure that the policies were working as intended. Given that it would have been very time
		consuming and expensive to test the policies against actual AWS instances, I used <a href="https://github.com/spulec/moto">Moto</a> to
		mock out all AWS services.
		</span>
		<span style="margin-left:2em">
		<br>Another project I worked on was automated provisioning of data center servers. To manage their on-premise servers, CME Group
		had just started using a third party software called <a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/">Cloudbolt</a>. Now, if a user wanted to provision a server
		using Cloudbolt, they would have to use a UI to specify configuration details such as RAM size, disk size, time to live, etc. I worked on automating this process
		writing a program that would take in a json file with all the configuration details and interacting
		with the Cloudbolt API to automatically provision a server with all the intended specifications.
